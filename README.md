# rest-assured-example
Simple rest-assured example, I focused on use as many function as possible from rest-assured.

Additional info:
1. Groovy
2. Rest-assured
3. JUnit5
4. Something like a Page Object Pattern - I segregated tests by each endpoint eg. /pet, /store.
5. REST API -> (https://petstore.swagger.io/#/)

Run all test:
`
./gradlew clean test
`
